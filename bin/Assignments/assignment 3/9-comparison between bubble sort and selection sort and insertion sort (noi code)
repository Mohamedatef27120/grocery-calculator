Bubble Sort :
Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements,
and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is
repeated until the list is sorted.

Best Case:        𝑂(𝑛)
Worst Case:       𝑂(𝑛2)
Average Case:     𝑂(𝑛2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selection Sort:
Description: Repeatedly finds the minimum element from the
unsorted part of the list and moves it to the sorted part.

Best Case:        𝑂(𝑛2)
Worst Case:       𝑂(𝑛2)
Average Case:     𝑂(𝑛2)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insertion Sort:
Builds the final sorted list one item at a time. It takes each element
and places it in the correct position within the sorted portion of the list.

Best Case:        𝑂(𝑛)
Worst Case:       𝑂(𝑛2)
Average Case:     𝑂(𝑛2)
