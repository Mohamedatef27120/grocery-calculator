Linear Search
Purpose: Checks each element in a list until the target element is found or the list ends.
Complexity:
Best Case:         𝑂(1)
Worst Case:        𝑂(𝑛)
Average Case:      𝑂(𝑛)

Binary Search
Purpose: Efficiently finds an element by dividing a sorted list into halves.
Complexity:
Best Case:        𝑂(1)
Worst Case:       𝑂(log 𝑛)
Average Case:     𝑂(log 𝑛)

...Linear Search is flexible for any list, regardless of order...
...Binary Search is more efficient but requires the list to be sorted...
